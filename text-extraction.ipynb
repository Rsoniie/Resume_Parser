Project Details  UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  ➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

Project Details  UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  ➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

Project Details  UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  ➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.  Technical and Co-Curricular activities  ➢ Star Performer in Microsoft IGTSC in 2014. ➢ Paper Presentations on Applications of Robotics in INOX 2K12. ➢ Attended a Three-Day workshop on C and C++ Programming and Aliasing. ➢ Attended a One-Day workshop on Java and Hardware Workshop at VECW ➢ Paper presentation 4G Technologies, Cloud Computing, Heuristic Algorithms and Applications, Open Source Software. ➢ Multimedia presentations on Artificial Intellegence, 6th Sense, and Robotics. ➢ Completed training of OCA (9i, 10g) from Oracle University. ➢ Attended SPARK training program in Infosys Mysore. ➢ Attended System Hardware Training program at HCL, Pondicherry. -> Skills\nPredictions:\n  Praveen Bhaskar -> Name\n  Program Manager (Software Delivery) -> Designation\n  Vadodara -> Location\n  Program Manager (Software Delivery) -> Designation\n  Vadodara -> Location\n  Pune -> Location\n  Pune -> Location\nPredictions:\n  Suman Biswas -> Name\n  Bengaluru -> Location\n  indeed.com/r/Suman-Biswas/63db95fe3ae14910 -> Email Address\n  Software Engineer -> Designation\n  Microsoft -> Companies worked at\n  Microsoft -> Companies worked at\n  Microsoft -> Companies worked at\n  MBA in Information Technology -> Degree\n  Bachelor of Arts  University of Calcutta -  Kolkata, West Bengal -> Degree\nPredictions:\n  Venkateswara D -> Name\n  Hyderabad -> Location\n  Certificate in MSC CHEMISTRY  Acharya Nagarjuna University -> Degree\n  MBA -> Companies worked at\n  Acharya Nagarjuna University -> College Name\n  Pune -> Location\nPredictions:\n  Sohan Dhakad -> Name\n  Shivpuri -> Location\n  Jiwaji University -> Designation\nPredictions:\n  Srushti Bhadale -> Name\n  Mumbai -> Location\n  indeed.com/r/Srushti-Bhadale/ffe3d9f99a4b3322 -> Email Address\n  Pune -> Location\n  Associate Consultant -> Designation\n  Bengaluru -> Location\n  HSC -> Degree\n  D.G Ruparel College -> College Name\n  Associate (Less than 1 year), CSS.

Project Details  UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  ➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

Project Details  UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  ➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.
